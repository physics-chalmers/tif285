    "There are several Bayesian approaches to accounting for outliers. They generally involve *modifying the statistical model*. For this data, it is abundantly clear that a simple straight line is not a good fit to our data. So let's propose a more complicated model that has the flexibility to account for outliers where the experimental error bar might have been underestimated. \n",
