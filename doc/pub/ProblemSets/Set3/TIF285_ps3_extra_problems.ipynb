    "- See deadline on the course web page\n",
    "- This problem set is solved individually. See examination rules on the course web page and the explanation of the examination procedure below.\n",
    "- The two notebooks for each problem set contain a number of basic and extra problems; you can choose which and how many to work on. The extra problems are usually more challenging.\n",
    "- Students are allowed to discuss together and help each other when solving the problems. However, every student must understand their submitted solution in the sense that they should be able to explain and discuss them with a peer or with a teacher.\n",
    "- While discussions with your peers are allowed (and even encouraged), direct plagiarism is not. Every student must reach their own understanding of submitted solutions according to the definition in the previous point.\n",
    "- The use of coding assistance from code generating artificial intelligence tools is allowed. However, every student must reach their own understanding of submitted solutions (including employed algorithms) according to the definition above.\n",
    "- Some problems include checkpoints in the form of `assert` statements. These usually check some basic functionality and you should make sure that your code passes these statements without raising an `AssertionError`. \n",
    "- Do not use other python modules than the ones included in the `environment.yml` file in the course github repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important:** The grading of problem sets requires **all** of the following actions:\n",
    "  1. Make sure to always complete **Task 0** in the header part of the notebook and that this part does not raise any `AssertionError`(s).\n",
    "  1. **Complete** the corresponding questions in Yata for every task that you have completed. This usually involves copying and pasting some code from your solution notebook and passing the code tests. You need to have a green check mark on Yata to get the corresponding points.\n",
    "  1. **Upload** your solution in the form of your edited version of this Jupyter notebook via the appropriate assignment module in Canvas (separate for basic and extra tasks). It is the code and results in your submitted notebook that is considered to be your hand-in solution.\n",
    "  1. If selected, be **available for a discussion** of your solution with one of the teachers on the Monday afternoon exercise session directly following the problem set deadline. No extra preparation is needed for these discussions apart from familiarity with your own solution. A list of randomly selected students will be published on the course web page around Monday noon. During the afternoon session that same day, students will be called in the numbered order until the end of the list (or the end of the exercise session). You must inform the responsible teacher as soon as possible following the publication of the student list if you can not be physically present at the exercise session (in which case we will have the discussion on zoom). An oral examination (on all aspects of the course) will be arranged during the exam week for students that do not show up for their discussion slot, or that fail to demonstrate familiarity with their hand-in solutions."
