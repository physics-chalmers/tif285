    "You might recognise this quantity as the *entropy* from statistical mechanics. The interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates.

However, in this simple example we can immediately realize that the assignment $p_1=0.07$ is the only one that implies no correlation between left-handedness and hair color. Any joint probability smaller than 0.07 implies that left-handed people are less likely to be blonde, and any larger vale indicates that left-handed people are more likely to be blonde.\n",
