    "Inference:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  \"the act of passing from one proposition, statement or judgment considered as true to another whose truth is believed to follow from that of the former\" (Webster) \n",
    "  Do premises $A, B, \\ldots \\Rightarrow$ hypothesis, $H$? \n",
    "\n",
    "Deductive inference:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the natural sciences, data is often a finite set of measurements while the process of learning is usually achieved by confronting that data with scientific theories and models. The conclusion might ultimately be falsification of an hypothesis underlying a theory or a model. However, it will not be an ultimate determination of the truth of an hypothesis. More commonly, the conclusion might be an improved model that can be used for predictions of new phenomena. Thus, we are typically dealing with inductive inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of learning from data is fundamental to the scientific wheel of progress.\n",

    "\n",
    "* To the pioneers such as Bernoulli, Bayes and Laplace, a probability represented a *degree-of-belief* or plausability: how much they thought that something as true based on the evidence at hand. This is the Bayesian approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To the 19th century scholars, this seemed too vague and subjective. They redefined probability as the *long run relative frequency* with which an event occurred, given (infinitely) many repeated (experimental) trials.\n",

    "### Machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic process illustrated in Fig. [fig-inference](#fig-inference) is employed also in the field of machine learning.

    "Thus, we will be able to study statistical inference methods for learning from data and use them in scientific applications. In particular, we will use **Bayesian statistics**. Simultaneously we will slowly develop a deeper understanding and probabilistic interpretation of machine learning algorithms through a statistical foundation. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Edwin Jaynes*, in his influential [How does the brain do plausible reasoning?](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-009-3049-0_1), wrote:\n",
    "> One of the most familiar facts of our experience is this: that there is such a thing as common sense, which enables us to do plausible reasoning in a fairly consistent way. People who have the same background of experience and the same amount of information about a proposition come to pretty much the same conclusions as to its plausibility. No jury has ever reached a verdict on the basis of pure deductive reasoning. Therefore the human brain must contain some fairly definite mechanism for plausible reasoning, undoubtedly much more complex than that required for deductive reasoning. But in order for this to be possible, there must exist consistent rules for carrying out plausible reasoning, in terms of operations so definite that they can be programmed on the computing machine which is the human brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jaynes went on to show that these \"consistent rules\" are just the rules of Bayesian probability theory, supplemented by Laplace's principle of indifference and, its generalization, Shannon's principle of maximum entropy. This key observation implies that a computer can be programmed to \"reason\", or, update probabilities based on data. Given some very minimal desiderata, the rules of Bayesian probability are the only ones which conform to what, intuitively, we recognize as rationality. Such probability update rules can be used recursively to impute causal relationships between observations, that is, a machine can be programmed to \"learn\".\n",

    "### How will this course be different from a computer science course?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will focus in particular on the statistical foundation for being able to learn from data, in particular we will take the Bayesian viewpoint of extended logic. Although we aim for theoretical depth, we will still take a practical learning approach with many opportunities to apply the theories in practice using simple computer programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, being this ambitious in teaching a theoretical foundation means that there will be less time to cover the plethora of machine learning methods, or to find examples from a very wide list of subfields in physics. We believe that striving for theoretical depth and obtaining your own computational experience will give the best preparation for being able to apply the knowledge in new situations and for real problems that will be encountered in future studies and work. \n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into\n",
    "two main categories.  In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a\n",
    "problem, and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other\n",
    "hand, *unsupervised learning* is a method for finding patterns and\n",
    "relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely\n",
    "*reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm of learning inspired by\n",
    "behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error,\n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the\n",
    "desired output of a system. What kind of inference are you hoping to see in your data? Is the aim to classify a result into categories, to predict a continuous value, or to simply observe patterns within the data? Let’s briefly introduce each class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification algorithms:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  are used to predict whether a dataset’s outputs can be separated into separate classes, binary or otherwise. These output values are discrete and represent target classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification algorithms undergo supervised training, which means they require labelled true output data in order to measure prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  can also be used for classification or simply to observe data patterns. By observing how the data is arranged within the feature space, clustering algorithms can utilize physical separation to create clusters. As such, some algorithms of this class don’t require output labels, making them unsupervised algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction algorithms:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  focuses on decreasing the number of features from your dataset, preventing your models from “overfitting” or generalizing on previously unseen data. They are also unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression algorithms:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set. The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values. These algorithms also require labelled true output data in order to measure prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the natural sciences, where we often confront scientific models with observations, there is certainly a large interest in regression algorithms. However, there are also many examples where other classes of machine-learning algorithms are being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods have three main ingredients in common, irrespective of whether we deal with supervised or unsupervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data set:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  The first, and most important, one is normally our data set (which can be subdivided into training and test data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Model:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  The second item is a model, which is normally a function of some parameters. The model reflects our knowledge of the system (or lack thereof). As an example, if we know that our data show a behavior similar to what would be predicted by a polynomial, fitting our data to a polynomial of some degree would then determine our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cost function:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  The last ingredient is a so-called cost function, which allows us to present an estimate on how good our model is in reproducing the data it is supposed to describe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python plays a central role in the development of machine\n",
    "learning techniques and tools for data analysis. In particular, given\n",
    "the wealth of machine learning and data analysis libraries written in\n",
    "Python, easy-to-use libraries with immediate visualization (and the\n",
    "impressive galleries of existing examples), the popularity of the\n",
    "Jupyter notebook framework (with the possibility to run **R** codes, or\n",
    "simulation programs written in compiled languages), and much more made our choice of\n",
    "programming language for this series of lectures easy. However,\n",
    "since the focus here is not only on using existing Python libraries such\n",
    "as **Scikit-Learn** or **Tensorflow**, but also on developing your own\n",
    "algorithms and codes, we will as far as possible present many of these\n",
    "algorithms as Python codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we also  mention compiled languages (like C, C++ or\n",
    "Fortran), is that Python is still notoriously slow when we do not\n",
    "utilize highly streamlined computational libraries \n",
    "written in compiled languages.  Therefore, analysis codes involving heavy Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations and high-dimensional optimization of cost functions, tend to utilize C++/C or Fortran codes for the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently thus, the community tends to let\n",
    "code written in C++/C or Fortran do the heavy duty numerical\n",
    "number crunching and leave the post-analysis of the data to the above\n",
    "mentioned Python modules or software packages.  However, with the developments taking place in for example the Python community, and seen\n",
    "the changes during the last decade, the above situation may change in the not too distant future. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data handling, machine learning  and ethical aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "In most of the cases we will study, we will generate the data\n",
    "to analyze ourselves. However, this does not hinder us from developing a sound\n",
    "ethical attitude to the data we use, how we analyze the data and how\n",
    "we handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most immediate and simplest possible ethical aspects deal with our\n",
    "approach to the scientific process. Nowadays, with version control\n",
    "software like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and various online\n",
    "repositories like [Github](https://github.com/),\n",
    "[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) etc, we can easily make our codes\n",
    "and data sets we have used, freely and easily accessible to a wider\n",
    "community. This helps us almost automagically in making our science\n",
    "reproducible. The large open-source development communities involved\n",
    "in say [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/),\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),\n",
    "[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), are\n",
    "all excellent examples of this. The codes can be tested and improved\n",
    "upon continuosly, helping thereby our scientific community at large in\n",
    "developing data analysis and machine learning tools.  It is much\n",
    "easier today to gain traction and acceptance for making your science\n",
    "reproducible. From a societal stand, this is an important element\n",
    "since many of the developers are employees of large public institutions like\n",
    "universities and research labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this more mechanical aspect of the ethics of science (in\n",
    "particular the reproducibility of scientific results) is something\n",
    "which is obvious and everybody should do so as part of the dialectics of\n",
    "science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, we should add a disclaimer. Even though\n",
    "we may dream of computers developing some kind of higher learning\n",
    "capabilities, at the end (even if the artificial intelligence\n",
    "community keeps touting our ears full of fancy futuristic avenues), it is we, yes you reading these lines,\n",
    "who end up constructing and instructing, via various algorithms, the\n",
    "machine learning approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "For self-driving vehicles, where the standard machine\n",
    "learning algorithms discussed here enter into the software, there are\n",
    "stages where we have to make choices. Yes, we, the humans who wrote\n",
    "a program for a specific brand of a self-driving car.  As an example,\n",
    "all carmakers have as their utmost priority the security of the\n",
    "driver and the accompanying passengers. A famous European carmaker, which is\n",
    "one of the leaders in the market of self-driving cars, had **if**\n",
    "statements of the following type: suppose there are two obstacles in\n",
    "front of you and you cannot avoid to collide with one of them. One of\n",
    "the obstacles is a monstertruck while the other one is a kindergarten\n",
    "class trying to cross the road. The self-driving car algo would then\n",
    "opt for the hitting the small folks instead of the monstertruck, since\n",
    "the likelihood of surving a collision with our future citizens, is\n",
    "much higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to serious ethical aspects. Why should we\n",
    "opt for such an option? Who decides and who is entitled to make such\n",
    "choices? Keep in mind that many of the algorithms you will encounter in\n",
    "this series of lectures or hear about later, are indeed based on\n",
    "simple programming instructions. And you are very likely to be one of\n",
    "the people who may end up writing such a code. Thus, developing a\n",
    "sound ethical attitude is much needed. The example of the self-driving cars is\n",
    "just one of infinitely many cases where we have to make choices. When\n",
    "you analyze data on economic inequalities, who guarantees that you are\n",
    "not weighting some data in a particular way, perhaps because you dearly want a\n",
    "specific conclusion which may support your political views?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have the answers here, nor will we venture into a deeper\n",
    "discussions of these aspects, but we want you think over these topics\n",
    "in a more overarching way.  A statistical data analysis with its dry\n",
    "numbers and graphs meant to guide the eye, does not necessarily\n",
    "reflect the truth, whatever that is.  As a scientist, and after a\n",
    "university education, you are supposedly a better citizen, with an\n",
    "improved critical view and understanding of the scientific method, and\n",
    "perhaps some deeper understanding of the ethics of science at\n",
