The development of this course would not have been possible without the knowledge that has been gained through the study of several excellent textbooks, most of which are listed as recommended course literature. Here is a short list of those references that I have found the most influential and inspirational:

o Phil Gregory, *``Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences''*, Cambridge University Press (2005).
o E. T. Jaynes, *``Probability Theory: The Logic of Science''*, Cambridge University Press (2003).
o David J.C. MacKay, *``Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms''*, Cambridge University Press (2005).
o D.S. Sivia, *``Data Analysis : A Bayesian Tutorial''*, Oxford University Press (2006).

Even more importantly I would like to thank a number of colleagues and friends that have been paramount for the evolution of this course and for the
development of the course material that is an integral part. In particular, I am in deep gratitude to:

* Prof. Richard Furnstahl, Ohio State University
* Prof. Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Oslo University and Michigan State University
* Prof. Daniel Phillips, Ohio University.

The list of people that have contributed with ideas, discussions, or by generously sharing their knowledge is very long. Rather than taking the risk of forgetting someone, I would just like to say thank you all. I am truly thankful for being part of an academic environment in which ideas and efforts are shared rather than kept isolated.

The last statement extends obviously to the open source communities that make so many great computing tools publicly available. In this course we take much advantage of open-source python libraries.
