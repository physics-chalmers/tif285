    "So far, we have been concerned with the problem of parameter estimation. In studying the linear relationship between two quantities, for example, we discussed how to infer the slope and the offset of the associated straight-line model. Often, however, there is a question as to whether a quadratic, or even cubic, function might be a more appropriate model. In this lecture, we will consider the broad class of scientific problems when there is uncertainty as to which one of a set of alternative models is most suitable. In the Bayesian terminology these can be labeled as **Model Selection** problems and we will discuss them in some depth.\n",

As usual, probability theory warns us immediately that the answer to our question depends partly on what we thought about the two theories before the analysis of the data. To be fair, we might take the ratio of the prior terms, on the far right of Eq. ([2](#eq:sivia_42)), to be unity; a harsher assignment could be based on the past track records of the theorists! To assign the probabilities involving the experimental measurements, $p(D|A,I)$ and $p(D|B,I)$, we need to be able to compare the data with the predictions of A and B: the larger the mismatch, the lower the corresponding probability.

    "The first term on the right-hand side reflects our relative prior preference for the alternative theories; to be fair, we can take it to be unity. The second term is a measure of how well the best predictions from each of the models agree with the data; with the added flexibility of his adjustable parameter, this maximum likelihood ratio can only favour B. The goodness-of-fit, however, cannot be the only thing that matters; if it was, we would always prefer more complicated explanations. Probability theory tells us that there is, indeed, another term to be considered. As assumed earlier in the evaluation of the marginal integral of Eq. ([3](#eq:sivia_43)), the prior range $\\lambda_\\mathrm{max} - \\lambda_\\mathrm{min}$ will generally be much larger than the uncertainty $\\pm\\delta\\lambda$ permitted by the data. As such, the final term in Eq. ([7](#eq:sivia_48)) acts to penalize B for the additional parameter; for this reason, it is often called an Ockham factor. That is to say, we have naturally encompassed the spirit of Ockham’s Razor: *‘Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora’* or, in English, *‘it is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer’* .\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is satisfying to quantify the everyday guiding principle attributed to the thirteenth-century Franciscan monk William of Ockham (or Occam, in Latin), that we should prefer the simplest theory which agrees with the empirical evidence, we should not get too carried away by it. After all, what do we mean by the simpler theory if alternative models have the same number of adjustable parameters? In the choice between Gaussian and Lorentzian peak shapes, for example, both are defined by the position of the maximum and their width. All that we are obliged to do, and have done, in addressing such questions is to adhere to the rules of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "While accepting the clear logic leading to Eq ([7](#eq:sivia_48)), many people rightly worry about the question of the limits $\\lambda_\\mathrm{min}$ and $\\lambda_\\mathrm{max}$. Jeffreys (1939) himself was concerned and pointed out that there would be an infinite penalty for any new parameter if the range was allowed to go to $\\pm\\infty$. Stated in the abstract, this would appear to be a severe limitation. In practice, however, it is not generally such a problem: since the analysis is always used in specific contexts, a suitable choice can usually be made on the basis of the relevant background information. Even in uncharted territory, a small amount of thought soon reveals that our state of ignorance is always far from the $\\pm\\infty$ scenario. If $\\lambda$ was the coupling constant (or strength) for a possible fifth force, for example, then we could put an upper bound on its magnitude because everybody would have noticed it by now if it had been large enough! We should also not lose sight of the fact that the precise form of Eq ([7](#eq:sivia_48)) stems from our stated simplifying approximations; if these are not appropriate, then eqns ([2](#eq:sivia_42)) and ([3](#eq:sivia_43)) will lead us to a somewhat different formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, our relative preference for A or B is dominated by the goodness of the fit to the data; that is to say, the maximum likelihood ratio in eqn ([7](#eq:sivia_48)) tends to overwhelm the contributions of the other two terms. The Ockham factor can play a crucial role, however, when both theories give comparably good agreement with the measurements. Indeed, it becomes increasingly important if B’s theory fails to give a significantly better fit as the quality of the data improves. In that case, $\\delta\\lambda$ continues to become smaller but the ratio of best-fit likelihoods remains close to unity; according to Eq. ([7](#eq:sivia_48)), therefore, A’s theory is favoured ever more strongly. By the same token, the Ockham effect disappears if the data are either few in number, of poor quality or just fail to shed new light on the problem at hand. This is simply because the posterior ratio of Eq. ([7](#eq:sivia_48)) is then roughly equal to the complementary prior one, since the empirical evidence is very weak; hence, there is no inherent preference for A’s theory unless it is explicitly encoded in $p(A|I)/p(B|I)$. This property can be verified formally by going back to Eqs. ([2](#eq:sivia_42)), ([5](#eq:sivia_45)) and ([6](#eq:sivia_46)), and considering the poor-data limit in which \n",

From the story of Dr A and Prof B, however, we find that the neglected term on the bottom plays a crucial role in ascertaining the merit of B’s theory relative to a competing alternative. In recognition of its new-found importance, the denominator in Bayes’ theorem is sometimes called the **‘evidence’** for B; it is also referred to as the ‘marginal likelihood’, the ‘global likelihood’ and the ‘prior predictive’.

    "Note that the Laplace approximation is basis-dependent: if $\\theta$ is transformed to a nonlinear function $u(\\theta)$ and the density is transformed to $P(u) = P(\\theta) |d\\theta/du|$ then in general the approximate normalizing constants $Z_Q$ will be different. This can be viewed as a defect---since the true value $Z_P$ is basis-independent in this approximation---or an opportunity, because we can hunt for a choice of basis in which the Laplace approximation is most accurate."
