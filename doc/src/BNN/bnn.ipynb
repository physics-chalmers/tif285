MLE can lead to severe overfitting though.\n",

Maximizing $p(\\mathcal{D} \\lvert \\boldsymbol{w}) p(\\boldsymbol{w})$ gives the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of $\\boldsymbol{w}$. Computing the MAP estimate has a regularizing effect and can prevent overfitting. The optimization objectives here are the same as for MLE plus a regularization term coming from the log prior.\n",

    "Since a forward pass involves a stochastic sampling step we have to apply the so-called *re-parameterization trick* for backpropagation to work. The trick is to sample from a parameter-free distribution and then transform the sampled $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ with a deterministic function $t(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})$ for which a gradient can be defined. In the blog post they choose $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ to be drawn from a standard normal distribution i.e. $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\boldsymbol{I})$ and the function $t$ is taken to be $t(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, i.e., it shifts the sample by mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and scales it with $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ where $\\odot$ is element-wise multiplication.\n",

    "For numerical stability the network is parametrized with $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ instead of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ is transformed with the softplus function to obtain $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\log(1 + \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}))$. This ensures that $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is always positive. As prior, a scale mixture of two Gaussians is used $p(\\boldsymbol{w}) = \\pi \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{w} \\lvert 0,\\sigma_1^2) + (1 - \\pi) \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{w} \\lvert 0,\\sigma_2^2)$ where $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$ and $\\pi$ are shared parameters. Their values are learned during training (which is in contrast to the paper where a fixed prior is used).\n",
