    "## Main task\n",
    "The overall project goal is to reproduce various results in a paper: [*Bayesian parameter estimation for effective field theories*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03618).  It's a long paper, so don't try to read all of it!  We'll guide you to the relevant parts. Sec. II of the paper is the most relevant, but you don't need to understand all of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper uses toy models for effective field theories (EFTs), namely Taylor series of some specified functions, to present guidelines for parameter estimation. We will not discuss the EFT concept in any detail, but will just mention that it is a type of approximation, or effective theory, for an underlying physical theory, such as a quantum field theory. An EFT includes the appropriate degrees of freedom to describe physical phenomena occurring at a chosen length scale or energy scale, while not resolving substructure and degrees of freedom at shorter distances (or, equivalently, at higher energies). \n",

One of these priors encapsulates the physics expectation that the parameters should be of \"natural\" size (order one).**\n",

    "* The `show_titles=True` option to corner will show central results and one-$\\sigma$ error limits on the projected posterior plots.\n",
    "* The `quantiles=[0.16, 0.5, 0.84]`option to corner adds the dashed vertical lines to the marginal posteriors on the diagonal. You can obviously change the quantiles if you want another credibility region.\n",
    "* The python command `np.percentile(samples, [16, 50, 84],axis=0)` might be useful to extract numerical values for the credibility region and the mean from a python array `samples`of shape (nsamples,ndimensions).\n",
    "* When reproducing Figures 3 and 4 you can use Matplotlib's `fill_between(x, y-error, y+error)` to make bands.  (Use the `alpha` keyword for `fill_between`, e.g., `alpha=0.5`, to make the bands more transparent.)"
