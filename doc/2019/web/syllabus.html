<h3>Course aim</h3>
<p>The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for performing scientific data analysis using statistical inference and machine learning. Much emphasis is put on practical applications of Bayesian inference in the natural and engineering sciences, i.e. the ability to quantify the strength of inductive inference from facts (such as experimental data) to propositions such as scientific hypotheses and models. </p>
<p>The course is project-based, and the students will be exposed to fundamental research problems through the various projects, with the aim to reproduce state-of-the-art scientific results. The students will use the Python programming language, with relevant open-source libraries, and will learn to develop and structure computer codes for scientific data analysis projects. </p>

  </p>

  <h4>Course organisation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Lectures with computer demonstrations</b>: background and theory, discussion problems, computer demonstrations using Jupyter notebooks.</li> 
    <li><b>Supervised computational exercises</b>: group work on exercises, problem sets, and numerical projects in the computer lab with supervision.</li>
    <li>Exercise- and project-based learning through work on analytical and numerical  exercises and problem sets plus computational projects with written reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Computer lab sessions</h4>
  <p>Should be used for working on projects, exercises and problem sets. The first hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects, exercises and problem sets.</p>

<h5>General recommendations:</h5>

	instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
    Weekly reading assignments and exercises provide hints to solve the projects and problem sets.
    </li>
    <li>
    Try to establish a practice where you log your work with the exercises and projects. You may find such a log book very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember what a previous test version of your program did. Here you could also record the time spent on solving the exercise, various algorithms you may have tested, or questions that you would like to discuss further with your lab partner or the supervisor.
    </li>
    <li>
    The course assumes a solid background in undergraduate mathematics (multivariable analysis, linear algebra, mathematical statistics). You might have to refresh your knowledge in these subjects by referring to undergraduate mathematics textbooks.
    </li>
    <li>
    We will use the Python programming language. In particular, we will use Jupyter notebooks when working on numerical exercises, problems, and projects. You might not have worked with these tools before, in which case you will have to learn as you go. The exercises are constructed to facilitate this learning, and we provide suggestions for useful electronic resources. You might have to use these references throughout the course, and you're also encouraged to discuss with the teaching assistants. Experience from using Matlab or similar interpreted languages should be sufficient for quickly getting up to speed.
    </li>
    <li>We will briefly discuss version control approaches for code development during this course. The use of such an approach is, however, not yet an official learning outcome and will not be the required practice for your work on numerical projects. Still, you are encouraged to try this approach and the teachers will be happy to discuss implementations and recommended work flows. Version control is the most ethical approach to computational research. All files that are associated with this course are available via a public repository on <a href="https://github.com/physics-chalmers/tif285">github</a> that you are welcome to clone.

<h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p>after completion of the course the student should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>integrate knowledge of common statistical distributions and central concepts in Bayesian statistics into the analysis of scientific data;</li>
<li>explain central aspects of Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains, and numerically apply these methods to sample multivariate probability densities;</li>
<li>quantify and critically assess uncertainties of model parameters that are statistically inferred from scientific data; perform model comparison using a Bayesian viewpoint;</li>
<li>understand and numerically implement several basic algorithms used in data analysis and  machine learning such as linear methods for regression and classification, simple neural networks and gaussian processes;</li>
<li>use python to perform scientific data analysis using statistical inference and machine learning and to visualize numerical results.</li>
<li>write well-structured technical reports where results and conclusions from a scientific data analysis are communicated in a clear way.</li>
<li>maintain a scientific and ethical conduct in the process of analyzing data and writing computer programs.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class='main_box'>
<h3>Examination</h3>
<p>The final grade is based on the performance on problem sets (performed individually) and the graded reports on computer projects (performed in groups of two students). There is no written exam. Ethical aspects will be explicitly examined.</p>

  <h4>Problem sets</h4>
  <p>There are three problem sets. These are strongly connected to the exercises that you will be working on in the computer labs. Each set contains a number of basic questions and a number of extra (often more advanced) ones. Some tasks are computational and it is recommended to work on them during the computer lab sessions. The problem sets are examined individually. <b>Both of the following two actions</b> must be performed for the problem set to be graded: Hand-in of solution code via Canvas and answering of short questions via OpenTA. </p>

  <h5>Deadline, exercises</h5> 
  <p>Hand-in via Canvas <b>and</b> OpenTA
  <ul>
  <li>Set 1: Friday, week 2</li>
  <li>Set 2: Friday, week 4 (2019: moved to week 5)</li>
  <li>Set 3: Friday, week 7 (2019: moved to week 8)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>Computer projects</h4>
  <p>There are two computational projects. Each project contains a basic and an extra (optional) task.
  <ul>
  <li>The projects are performed in groups of two students. Join a project group via Canvas.</li>
  <li>Each group has to hand in a written report (pdf format) that will be graded. See detailed instructions in the problem formulations.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h5>Deadline, projects</h5> 
  <p>Hand-in via Canvas
  <ul>
  <li>Project 1: Friday, week 5</li>
  <li>Project 2: Friday, week 8 (2019: moved to exam week)</li>
  </ul>
  Projects that are handed in post deadline will only be eligible for basic points and will be graded in December (handed in before Nov. 30th) or August (handed in before July 31st).</p>

<h4>Basic and extra points</h4>
<p>
Basic and extra points are awarded through the problem sets and the projects.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Basic points are the following:</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li>10+10+10 on the three problem sets.
	These are typically associated with basic problems.</li>
	<li>15+15 on the two projects.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
<dt>Extra points are the following:</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li>6+6+8 extra points on the three problem sets.
	These correspond to optional problems that are typically more advanced (clearly marked).</li>
	<li>10+10 extra points for the two projects.
	These would correspond to an extra (optional) task.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Grading system</h4>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>Pass (grade 3 / G / E)</dt>
<dd>In order to pass the course you need to have &ge;20% basic points per task (i.e. 2 basic points / problem set and 3 basic points / project), <b>and</b> you need &ge;24/60 basic points in total.</dd>
<dt>Pass with distinction</dt>
<dd>In order to pass the course with distinction (high grade) you need &ge;40% basic points per task (i.e. 4 basic points / problem set and 6 basic points / project) <b>and</b> a certain amount of basic + extra points in total (see table below).
</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>The final grade, <b>given that the above requirements are fulfilled</b>, is determined according to:
   <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Basic points<br/> (max 60)</th>
       <th>Total points<br/> (max 100)</th>
       <th>Chalmers<br/> scale </th>
       <th>GU<br/> scale </th>
       <th>ECTS<br/> scale </th>
     </tr>

       <td> &ge; 36 </td>
       <td> &ge; 80 </td>
       <td> 5 </td>
       <td> VG </td>
       <td> A </td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td> &ge; 36 </td>
       <td> 70 - 79 </td>
       <td> 4 </td>
       <td> VG </td>
       <td> B </td>
     </tr> 

     <tr>
       <td> &ge; 36 </td>
       <td> 60 - 69 </td>
       <td> 4 </td>
       <td> G </td>
       <td> C </td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td> &ge; 24 </td>
       <td> 50 - 59 </td>
       <td> 3 </td>
       <td> G </td>
       <td> D </td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td> &ge; 24 </td>
       <td> 24 - 49 </td>
       <td> 3 </td>
       <td> G </td>
       <td> E </td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
       <td> < 24 </td>
       <td> < 24 </td>
       <td> U </td>
       <td> U </td>
	   <td> F </td>
     </tr>
